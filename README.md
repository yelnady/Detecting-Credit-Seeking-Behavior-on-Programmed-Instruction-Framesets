# Detecting Credit-Seeking Behavior on Programmed Instruction Framesets
 This study examines how students' behavior when using an online eTextbook affects their performance in a Formal Languages course. Two types of behavior, credit-seeking and knowledge-seeking, are analyzed through coarse and fine-grained approaches. Results show credit-seeking behavior negatively impacts learning outcomes, and the type of PI frameset influences this behavior. Machine learning models predict grades based on credit-seeking behavior. A semi-supervised learning model assists in labeling work sessions.
